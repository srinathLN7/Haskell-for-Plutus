# Learn Haskell for Plutus - Cardano

This repository is a collection of the list of haskell programs and lecture notes written during my adventure in learning haskell - a lazy, statically typed, pure functional programming language used to develop smart contracts in the [cardano](https://docs.cardano.org/) blockchain. Being a firm believer of the philosophy "Less is more" when it comes to programming, the more I learn haskell, the more I fall in love with its simplicity and elegance. Haskell makes me go "Wowwwwww!" 

**What about you? Do you like writing 1000's of lines of code that doing 1 thing or 1 line of code doing 1000 things?** 


## Recommended Video Lectures and Tutorials

**Prof. Graham Huttom Lecture Series - Highly Recommended**

I thoroughly enjoyed watching Professor Graham Hutton lecture series on Functional programming in Haskell and would highly recommend for any haskell beginner. He explains the functional programming paradigm using the first-principles approach.
